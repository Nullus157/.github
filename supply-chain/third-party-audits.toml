This is a stronger requirement than the built-in safe-to-deploy criteria,
motivated by Chromium's rule-of-two related requirements:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/rule-of-2.md#unsafe-code-in-safe-languages

This crate will not introduce a serious security vulnerability to production
software exposed to untrusted input.

Auditors are not required to perform a full logic review of the entire crate.
Rather, they must review enough to fully reason about the behavior of all unsafe
blocks and usage of powerful imports. For any reasonable usage of the crate in
real-world software, an attacker must not be able to manipulate the runtime
behavior of these sections in an exploitable or surprising way.

Ideally, ambient capabilities (e.g. filesystem access) are hardened against
manipulation and consistent with the advertised behavior of the crate. However,
some discretion is permitted. In such cases, the nature of the discretion should
be recorded in the `notes` field of the audit record.

Any unsafe code in this crate must, in general, be kept well-contained, and
documentation must exist to describe how Rust's invariants are being upheld
despite the unsafe block(s). Nontrivial uses of unsafe must be reviewed by an
expert in Rust's unsafety guarantees/non-guarantees.

For crates which generate deployed code (e.g. build dependencies or procedural
macros), reasonable usage of the crate should output code which meets the above
criteria."""

Some unsafe usage for JNI/FFI, such as implementing extern \"C\" functions for
NativeActivity and to use the `ndk_sys` FFI bindings for the Android NDK libraries.

The GameActivity backend depends on around 2k lines of third-party C/C++ code from Google
as well as around 500 lines of C++ code for the GameText (input method) support.
The C/C++ code is compiled with the `cc` crate.

Although I have reviewed all of the C/C++ code for GameActivity + GameText there
could be unknown soundness issues in there or potentially in any of the Android
NDK APIs used, which are generally also implemented in C/C++.

There is an implementation of SipHash in cxx/ at src/sip.rs. This hash is not
considered cryptographically secure, and is not used within a context where
cryptographic security is critical. Hence, it's not considered to be an

More directly, its current usage is just in HashMap, and its purposes are:

`SigningKey::from([u8; 32])` parsing now uses `Scalar::from_bytes_mod_order` instead of
`Scalar::from_bits`. This means that the clamped scalar bits are now reduced before they
are used, which removes the implicit mul-by-cofactor during scalar multiplication (as the
last 3 bits of the scalar are no longer guaranteed to be zero). However, this happens to
be fine in the context of this crate:

- `SigningKey` does not expose its inner `Scalar` directly, so we only need to consider
  how it is used within the crate.
- For multiplication within a prime-order (sub)group, we get the same result whether we
  reduce before or not. This means that the field-element multiplication during signing,
  and the prime-order subgroup component of any group-element scalar multiplication, are
  unaffected.
- The only group element that the `Scalar` is multiplied by is the Ed25519 basepoint,
  which is torsion free (so the implicit mul-by-cofactor is unnecessary).

The new `getrandom_uninit` method is introduced by retrofitting every system
implementation to take `&mut [MaybeUninit<u8>]` instead of `&mut [u8]`.

Most implementations are only altered to update their signature, and to
internally cast the slice back to `*mut u8` when writing to it. All of these
backends appear to write bytes to the full length of the slice, so it should be
fully initialized afterwards, upholding the invariants of the new `unsafe` code
in the public APIs.

- I did not check the behaviour of each implementation's system method to ensure
  they never write uninitialized bytes; the code prior to this change already
  needed to uphold that invariant as it was writing into `&mut [u8]`.

The following system implementations have additional `unsafe` code modifications:

- `custom`: The slice is zero-filled to ensure the `MaybeUninit<u8>` doesn't
  escape into a system implementation that might not write initialized bytes
  into the entire slice. The internal API between registration and usage is also
  switched from C ABI to Rust ABI, to guard against potential panics.

- `emscripten`: New backend, implementation looks reasonable.

- `hermit`: New backend, writes incrementally to the slice, but ensures that the
  entire slice has been written to before returning `Ok(())`. I note that it is
  possible for the implementation to loop indefinitely if `sys_read_entropy`
  were to always return 0 for some reason.

- `js`: Adds chunking to limit each write to less than 2^31 (but that seems like
  a bugfix). The safety requirements for `Uint8Array::view_mut_raw` appear to be
  satisfied.

- `rdrand`: Code changes to better handle CPU families with broken RDRAND.

- `solaris_illumos`: Now uses `GRND_RANDOM`.

- `windows`: Added `RtlGenRandom` fallback for non-UWP Windows.

Aims to provide a safe JNI (Java Native Interface) API over the
unsafe `jni_sys` crate.

This is a very general FFI abstraction for Java VMs with a lot of unsafe code
throughout the API. There are almost certainly some edge cases with its design
that could lead to unsound behaviour but it should still be considerably safer
than working with JNI directly.

A lot of the unsafe usage relates to quite-simple use of `from_raw` APIs to
construct or cast wrapper types (around JNI pointers) which are fairly
straight-forward to verify/trust in context.

Some unsafe code has good `// # Safety` documentation (this has been enforced for
newer code) but a lot of unsafe code doesn't document invariants that are
being relied on.

The design depends on non-trivial named lifetimes across many APIs to associate
Java local references with JNI stack frames.

The crate is not very actively maintained and was practically unmaintained for
over a year before the 0.20 release.

Robert Bragg who now works at Embark Studios became the maintainer of this
crate in October 2022.

In the process of working on the `jni` crate since becoming maintainer it's
worth noting that I came across multiple APIs that I found needed to be
re-worked to address safety issues, including ensuring that APIs that are not
implemented safely are correctly declared as `unsafe`.

There has been a focus on improving safety in the last two release.

The jni crate has been used in production with the Signal messaging application
for over two years:
https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/blob/main/rust/bridge/jni/Cargo.toml

# Some Notable Open Issues
- https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/422 - questions soundness of linking
  multiple versions of jni crate into an application, considering the use
  of (separately scoped) thread-local-storage to track thread attachments
- https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/405 - discusses the ease with which
  code may expose the JVM to invalid booleans with undefined behaviour

Uses `unsafe` blocks to interact with `windows-sys` crate.
- `SHGetKnownFolderPath` safety requirements are met.
- `CoTaskMemFree` has no effect if passed `NULL`, so there is no issue if some
  future refactor created a pathway where `ffi::Guard` could be dropped before
  `SHGetKnownFolderPath` is called.
- Small nit: `ffi::Guard::as_pwstr` takes `&self` but returns `PWSTR` which is
  the mutable type; it should instead return `PCWSTR` which is the const type
  (and what `lstrlenW` takes) instead of implicitly const-casting the pointer,
  as this would better reflect the intent to take an immutable reference.
- The slice constructed from the `PWSTR` correctly goes out of scope before
  `guard` is dropped.
- A code comment says that `path_ptr` is valid for `len` bytes, but `PCWSTR` is
  a `*const u16` and `lstrlenW` returns its length \"in characters\" (which the
  Windows documentation confirms means the number of `WCHAR` values). This is
  likely a typo; the code checks that `len * size_of::<u16>() <= isize::MAX`.

I have performed a very rough survey of the changes and didn't see anything
obviously out of place, or that looks like a silent ABI break on a platform
Wasmtime supports. I didn't check all the new struct layouts, constants,
function signatures, and so on for ABI conformance though.

This crate is maintained by the Rust project and is a dependency of the Rust
standard library itself. It contains tests that generate C source files to
ensure that the ABI it describes matches the ABI described by the C header
files in the correspond to match.

The bundled zlib C sources were not audited as a part of this. However, I did
compare the vendored sources present in this crate with their upstream repos.

There was no diff between zlib/ and https://zlib.net/fossils/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz.

zlib-ng did not provide a version, so I ran diff across everything in zlib-ng's
commit history. The closest upstream SHA was
cf89cf35037f152ce7adfeca864656de5d33ea1e with 8 lines of output from

This crate is a Rust implementation of zlib compression/decompression and has
been used by default by the Rust standard library for quite some time. It's also
a default dependency of the popular `backtrace` crate for decompressing debug
information. This crate forbids unsafe code and does not otherwise access system
resources. It's originally a port of the `miniz.c` library as well, and given
its own longevity should be relatively hardened against some of the more common
compression-related issues.

Migrates from winapi to windows-sys. The changes to API usage look reasonable
based on what I've seen in other uses of the windows-sys crate. Unsafe code
falls into two categories:
- Usage of `mem::zeroed()`, which doesn't look obviously wrong. The
  `..unsafe { mem::zeroed() }` in `sys::unix::selector::kqueue` looks weird
  but AFAICT is saying \"take any unspecified fields from an instance of this
  struct that has been zero-initialized\", which is fine for integer fields. It
  would be nice if there was documentation to this effect (explaining why this
  is done instead of `..Default::default()`).
- Calls to Windows API methods. These are either pre-existing (and altered for
  the differences in the crate abstractions), or newly added in logic that
  appears to be copied from miow 0.3.6 (I scanned this by eye and didn't see
  any noteworthy changes other than handling windows-sys API differences).

notes = """
`proc-macro2` acts as either a thin(-ish) wrapper around the std-provided
`proc_macro` crate, or as a fallback implementation of the crate, depending on
where it is used.

If using this crate on older versions of rustc (1.56 and earlier), it will
temporarily replace the panic handler while initializing in order to detect if
it is running within a `proc_macro`, which could lead to surprising behaviour.
This should not be an issue for more recent compiler versions, which support
`proc_macro::is_available()`.

The `proc-macro2` crate's fallback behaviour is not identical to the complex
behaviour of the rustc compiler (e.g. it does not perform unicode normalization
for identifiers), however it behaves well enough for its intended use-case
(tests and scripts processing rust code).

`proc-macro2` does not use unsafe code, however exposes one `unsafe` API to
allow bypassing checks in the fallback implementation when constructing
`Literal` using `from_str_unchecked`. This was intended to only be used by the
`quote!` macro, however it has been removed
(https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/commit/f621fe64a8a501cae8e95ebd6848e637bbc79078),
and is likely completely unused. Even when used, this API shouldn't be able to
cause unsoundness.

This is a fairly straightforward FFI wrapper crate for `regex`, maintained by
the `regex` developers in the same repository.

This crate is explicitly designed for FFI use, and should not be used directly
by Rust code. The exported `extern \"C\"` functions are not marked as `unsafe`,
meaning that it is technically incorrect to use them from within Rust code,
however they are reasonable to use from C code.

The unsafe code in this crate heavily depends on the C caller maintaining
invariants, however these invariants are clearly documented in the `rure.h`
file, bundled with the crate.

I have checked the signatures of each function both in C++ and in the Rust to
ensure they match.  In some places, the c `rure.h` header file is missing a
`const` qualifier which could be present given the Rust code, however this will
have no impact on ABI, and is fairly normal for FFI crates.

Panics are handled in all Rust FFI methods, meaning that projects which do not
disable unwinding will still consistently abort (using `libc::abort()`) if a
panic occurs in the Rust code.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.
